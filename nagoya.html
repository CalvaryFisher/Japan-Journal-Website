        <h1>Nagoya (名古屋)</h1>
        <p>Nagoya, the fourth largest city in Japan, was once a key strategic center between Kyoto 
            (the historical capital of the emperor) and Edo (modern day Tokyo) where the ruling samurai government was headquartered for much of Japan's history.
        </p>
        <p>Rather like the nobles of old, my family and I enjoyed a rest in Nagoya on our way from Tokyo to Kyoto!</p>
        
        <h2>1. Arrival</h2>
        <p>After the busyness of Tokyo, and getting floored by culture shock, Nagoya felt like a breath of fresh air.
            Though still the 4th largest city in Japan, it felt much more manageable and less overwhelming than Tokyo.
            Multiple members of my family even remarked "wow, I could live here!"
        </p>
        <p>We also enjoyed our stay at the The Lamp Light Books Hotel. As a family of bookworms and coffee lovers the vibes in the lounge felt comforting while navigating so many new things.</p>
