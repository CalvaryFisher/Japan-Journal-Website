# Purpose:
My Japan Journal Website will serve as a digital scrapbook for my family‚Äôs trip to Japan! üìëüóæ‚úàÔ∏è

# Features:
1. ### Webpages show pictures, text, etc.

2. ### I want a pretty main page that leads to 3 main areas:
1) Topical areas i.e. Culture, Faith, Cuisine, etc. (Easiest)
2) Search bar for topics and articles. (A common functionality on many websites)
3) Timeline / Map of journey with clickable links to blog posts and resources on those areas. (More complex & requires more creativity.)

3. ### I want small blog posts with pictures, text, animations, videos, links, etc.
4. ### Stretch goals:
- Dark Mode Toggle
- A blog writing feature that makes it easy for me to submit text, pictures, etc. to the website.
This would require setting up a login system, different admin users, etc.
