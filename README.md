# Purpose:
My Japan Journal Website will serve as a digital scrapbook for my family‚Äôs trip to Japan! üìëüóæ‚úàÔ∏è
It will also share other experiences with Japanese culture (such as learning the language, getting ready for the trip, etc.)

# Features:
1. ### Webpages show pictures, text, etc.

2. ### I want a pretty main page that leads to 3 main areas:
- Timeline / Map of journey with clickable links to blog posts and resources on those areas.
- Topical areas i.e. Culture, Faith, Cuisine, etc.
- Search bar for topics and articles.

3. ### I want small blog posts with pictures, text, animations, videos, links, etc.
4. ### Dark Mode Toggle
5. ### Stretch goals:
- A blog writing feature that makes it easy for me to submit text, pictures, etc. to the website.
This would require setting up a login system, different admin users, etc.
